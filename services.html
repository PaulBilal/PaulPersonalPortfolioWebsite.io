            <p>
              I specialise in rabbit breeding. I also grow vegetables which I sell to the informal 
              market, although I have intentions of supplying big markets some day. I love agriculture
              as a whole, and I strongly believe agriculture is one industry that will never perish 
              because as people we need to consume food daily. There are a lot of job creation 
              opportunities in the agricultural space. I supply rabbit manure fertilizer which is high
              in Nitrogen and has an NPK of 2:1:1.
            </p>
          </br>
            <p>
              I have intentions of venturing more into meat production and gaining the knowlwdge 
              required. I also plan to gain and apply knowledge of soil preservation, crop production, 
              as well as how to counter act naturally occuring enviromental issues such as soil erosion.
              As a small scale farmer, I care for the soil and encourage taking care of the soil, not 
              only for us but for fututre generations as well, and that being said, I strongly 
              encourage other farmers as well to practice organic farming, which is good for the soil,
              and preserves it.
            </p>
          </br>
          <p>
            As mentioned before, there is definitely a link between technology and agriculture, and I 
            aim to utilise my skill sets, and natural intuition to apply my knowledge and make the 
            farming journey easier for me and those around me.

            <p>
                I love the technology and evolution the blockchain technology has come with. It makes 
                use of security measures such as cryptographic security and smart contracts for 
                authorising transactions and maintaining the integrity of the ledgers. I find the 
                idea of decentralisation very fascinating and bold.
           
                So with more incoming data and algorithms improving, blockchain technology is 
                definitely a space we are still going to experience more on. Blockchain technology is 
                not only utilised in crypto currencies and NFTs, but can also be used for security 
                because it is as if it's impenetrable

            <p>
              I have a deep passion for robotics engineering. It's a path I have been 
              fascinated with from a very young age. I believe it would be a really good 
              initiative that robotics and coding be introduced to the basic education 
              syllabus because it exercises the brain in a very crucial way. 
          
              Robotics also
              plays an enormous role in modern day businesses. For example in the banking 
              industry robots and artificial intelligence are being utilised to assist 
              clients with basic services which make things easier and faster. The same is 
              slowly being introduced in restaurants as well, thus showing the growing potential 
              of robotics.

            <p>
              I run atleast 4 times a week. I run because I find joy in running, and also because it is
              a healthy habit and it keeps the brain awake. I started my running journey in about 2019,
              but not professionally running, just exercising the body here and there. At the back of 
              my mind, I always had intetions of taking it serious, and it was only in 2023 that I 
              decided to actually take it serious and go compete in marathons.
            </p>
          </br>
            <p>
              The longest distance I have ran so far is 32km, and I aim to complete atleast 70km by 
              the end of 2024, as I will be enrolling for the Comrades Marathon for the first time in 
              2025. So I definitely love running, the feeling one gets after running, the fantastic 
              people one comes across on the running journey, as well as the amount of opportunities 
              that present themselves at such gatherings.
            </p>
          </br>
          <p>
            I have ambitions of participating in international marathons in places such as Italy, 
            Turkey, Netherlands, and so forth. I believe the experience would be good for me because
            I would be interacting with people from different places and learning their different 
            ways of doing things.

            <p>
              I view photography as a method of relieving myself from work and all other things. I have 
              been shooting pictures of objects since my early high school days, and that is where the 
              love of photography came from. I take pictures of objects and focus on the details of the 
              object rather than taking pictures of people.
            </p>
          </br>
          <p>
            When I do not have the motivation to code, I simply take my camera and go around in the 
            yard and finding objects to capture. Being out in the open like that refreshes my mind 
            and then I can go back to work with an open mind.

            <p>
              Agriculture and technology go hand in hand. Things like drone technology are being 
              utilised in the farming industry to capture data, get aerial photographs, and many more 
              reasons. Technology definitely makes life easier for farmers and saves time and money, 
              which is the end goal of every farmer.
            </p>
          </br>
            <p>
              Technology offers various farming solutions like bracelets which monitor a farm worker's 
              location while at work, as well as their coming in to work as well as their depature. such
              technologies are helpful because they can keep track of employee daily activity and use 
              the data to put it back into their business for more informed business decions.
